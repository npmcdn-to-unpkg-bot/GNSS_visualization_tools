    <p>The goal while developping this application was to create a simple graphical interface for GNSS data visualization.</p>
    <p>More precisely, users should be able to see the main differences between two trajectories, with an access to detailed data of
    any point by clicking on it. Thus, it is really easy to compare for instance the data generated by a GNSS generator and the
    calculated data of a receiver.</p>
    <p>A database of several scenarios already run is avalaible by clicking on the "run" button. User can choose among 6 scenarios :
    circle, square, free to urban, CN0, static or acceleration.</p>
    <p>This application can still be improved, especially in the way information are displayed. </p>
