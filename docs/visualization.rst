Play a scenario
--------------------

    Six scenarios are already stored in the database : Circle, Square, Static, Acceleration, Sensivity and
Free to urban tests. You can choose to run any one these in order to visualize the trajectory. You just
have to select it in the list, then click on the "Run" button.

    A map appears on the screen, centered on the coordinates where the scenario is played.

    There are two differents trajectories for each scenario :

- The blue one represents the estimated position calculated by the receiver

- The red one represents the true position generated by the generator
